Numpy Practice Questions
1. Define two custom numpy arrays, say A and B. Generate two new numpy arrays by stacking A and B vertically and horizontally.
2. Find common elements between A and B. [Hint : Intersection of two sets]
3. Extract all numbers from A which are within a specific range. eg between 5 and 10. [Hint: np.where() might be useful or boolean masks]
4. Filter the rows of iris_2d that has petallength (3rd column) > 1.5 and sepallength (1st column) < 5.0
	url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
	iris_2d = np.genfromtxt(url, delimiter=',', dtype='float', usecols=[0,1,2,3])


Practice Questions for Pandas

1. From df filter the 'Manufacturer', 'Model' and 'Type' for every 20th row starting from 1st (row 0).

```
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/Cars93_miss.csv')
```

2. Replace missing values in Min.Price and Max.Price columns with their respective mean.

```
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/Cars93_miss.csv')
```

3. How to get the rows of a dataframe with row sum > 100?

```
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(10, 40, 60).reshape(-1, 4))
```

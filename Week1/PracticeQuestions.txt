1. Display Fibonacci Series upto 10 terms

# Initialize the first two terms
a, b = 0, 1

# Display the first term
print(a)

# Display the next 9 terms
for _ in range(9):
    a, b = b, a + b
    print(a)

2. Display numbers at the odd indices of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Iterate through the list using a loop and print numbers at odd indices
for i in range(1, len(my_list), 2):
    print(my_list[i])

3. Print a list in reverse order
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a loop to iterate through the list in reverse order and print each element
for i in range(len(my_list) - 1, -1, -1):
    print(my_list[i])

4. Your task is to count the number of different words in this text
	
	string = """
	ChatGPT has created this text to provide tips on creating interesting paragraphs. 
	First, start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. 
	Then, support the topic sentence with specific details, examples, and evidence.
	Vary the sentence length and structure to keep the reader engaged.
	Finally, end with a strong concluding sentence that summarizes the main points.
	Remember, practice makes perfect!
	"""

words = string.split()
unique_words = set(words)
word_count = len(unique_words)
print(word_count)

5. Write a function that takes a word as an argument and returns the number of vowels in the word

def count_vowels(word):
    vowels = "AEIOUaeiou"
    count = 0
    for char in word:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

word = "example"
print(count_vowels(word))

6. Iterate through the following list of animals and print each one in all caps.

  animals=['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']
animals = ['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.upper())

7. Iterate from 1 to 15, printing whether the number is odd or even
for num in range(1, 16):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")

8. Take two integers as input from user and return the sum
num1 = int(input("Enter the first integer: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second integer: "))
sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_of_numbers}")

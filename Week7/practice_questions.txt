#####LOGISTIC REGRESSION#########

1. Try different thresholds for computing predictions. By default it is 0.5. Use predict_proba function to compute probabilities and then try custom thresholds and see their impact on Accuracy, Precision and Recall

2. Do the same analysis for other columns

3. Fit a Logistic Regression Model on all features. Remember to preprocess data(eg. normalization and one hot encoding)

4. Plot ROC Curves for each model


######CLUSTERING#########
1. Repeat the above exercise for different values of k
 - How do the inertia and silhouette scores change?
 - What if you don't scale your features?
 - Is there a 'right' k? Why or why not?


2. Repeat the following exercise for food nutrients dataset
